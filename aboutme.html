    <h1 class="generalheader" style="text-align: center;">My Story </h1>
    <p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; text-indent: 50px;">My parents used to live in a small commune in Southern Indiana called "Padanaram". My mom is the grandaughter of the founder of the commune.
        At one point, they decided to leave, and my mom went to medical school, and we moved away. But I still have a lot of connection to "The Valley", as it is nicknamed.

    <br>
    <p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; text-indent: 50px;"> I grew up in Bedford, before moving to Bloomington for High-School. Since then, I've been exploring coding through Bloomington South's CS classes, slowly gaining experience and understanding of computers.
    <br>
    <p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; text-indent: 50px;">
    I'm also a Type-1 Diabetic, something that has, interestingly, spiked some more interest in computer science. In order to predict blood sugar in live time, there is a sensor and algorithm, developed by a programmer. At some point, I'd like to be able to understand, and maybe help with, the development of such life-saving technologies.

    <h1 class="generalheader" style="text-align: center;">My Nextech Journey </h1>
    <p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; text-indent: 50px;"> I came to Nextech to help me gain a better understanding of computer science and the careers that encompass it. 
    I've always been split between being a doctor, helping patients like my mom does every day, or being a computer scientist, as I've come to enjoy the development process a lot.
    </p><p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%;">Through my time at Nextech, I've come to meet a great group of people, and I've learned a lot. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity. </p> 
    <hr style="border-color: #da4747;"> 
    <h1 class="generalheader" style="text-align: center;">Where I Want to Go </h1>
    <p class="intro1" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; text-indent: 50px;">
        As I've stated, I want to either become a doctor or a computer scientist. I want to be able to help the world with whatever I have, and whether that's through working with a patient, or through making an algorithm to predict low blood sugars, I hope to make a change.
